## About Me
I am a junior engineer with over 2 years of part-time experience specializing in data engineering and BI writing primarily Python.
Through my univerisy studies and projects focusing on computer hardware, I have a strong knowledge of [computer architecture](https://github.com/mattnkrueger/computer-architecture-projects-and-hw-ece-3350/tree/main/project), [embedded systems](https://github.com/mattnkrueger/embedded-game-console), [IoT](https://github.com/mattnkrueger/iot-thermostat-analytics-dashboard), and real-time cyber-physical systems.

My Goto Language:
Python

I am in no means an expert - and will never claim to be - but I am deeply passionate about learning different areas of engineering and software development. 
Python satisfies (most) of my needs at this stage of my career, and its active community, extensive packages, and accessible resources make learning extremely easy and fun. 

Here are my most frequently utilized packages:
PySpark, Pandas, Plotly Dash, SqlAlchemy, Flask

Other languages I have written code in (but am much less confident using):
c/c++, java, verilog, javascript, react

Tools I use frequently:
Tableau, Figma, Docker, Databricks
